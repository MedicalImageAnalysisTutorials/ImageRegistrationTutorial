# ImageRegistrationTutorial

This repository provides colab python notebooks (you can also run these notebooks using jupyter) that help beginners to learn and practice image registration in a simple way using arrays. I try to explain the math behind image registration components using simple python code.

Your feedback and support is appreciated.
