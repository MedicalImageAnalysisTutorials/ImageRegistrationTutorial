# Image Registration Tutorials

This repository provides colab python notebooks (you can also run these notebooks using jupyter) that help beginners to learn and practice image registration in a simple way using arrays. I try to explain the math behind image registration components using simple python code.

Your feedback and support is appreciated.

Other TODOs:
- Colab Tutorial:
  - colab interface and menus 
  - create a notebook and run your first code
  - navigate between sections.
  - Advance: 
    - customise you keyboard shortcut
    - change runtime type
    - connect to google drive
    - basic linux commands

- Youtube version with English and Arabic languages.
- Youtube: building ITK from source on clean ubuntu 20.04 system , building and run first example, tracing some code.
